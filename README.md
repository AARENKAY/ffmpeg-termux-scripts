📱 FFmpeg Scripts for Termux on Android

Hi there! 👋
I'm not a coder, just someone who tinkers and likes to automate things a bit.
These scripts were made using AI tools like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and a lot of trial and error on Android + Termux.
I found them helpful, so I'm sharing them here in case they help someone else too. Feel free to edit, improve, or remix them as you like! 😊
